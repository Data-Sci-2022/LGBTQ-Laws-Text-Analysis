Mack's term project for Data Science analyzing the text of LGBTQ+ laws in the USA.

## Websites used in this analysis



This research project will analyze pro- and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from the US to see what statistical connection there is between the language used in the legislation and its equality index as assigned by [Equaldex](https://www.equaldex.com/equality-index) and its overall LGBTQ Policy tally as calculated by the [Movement Advancement Project](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps).

## Repo organization:

* [Data](/data) - All data files used in the analysis.
* [State-Bill-csvs](/data/State-Bill-csvs) is separated into [Anti](/data/State-Bill-csvs/Anti) and [Pro](/data/State-Bill-csvs/Pro).
* [BillTrack DF](/data/statetextdf.csv) is a dataframe of BillTrack information, to avoid scraping.
* [State Text DF](/data/statetextdf.csv) is a dataframe of bill texts, to avoid having to scrape and compile the data.
* [Data Visualization](/data_visualization) - all graphs generated from my [analysis walkthrough]().
* [Analysis Walkthrough](./analysis_walkthrough) goes through all the code I used to collection and manipulate my data.
