# LGBTQ-Laws-Text-Analysis

Mack's term project for Data Science analyzing the text of LGBTQ+ laws in the USA.

This research project will analyze pro- and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation from the US to see what statistical connection there is between the language used in the legislation and its equality index as assigned by [Equaldex](https://www.equaldex.com/equality-index) and its overall LGBTQ Policy tally as calculated by the [Movement Advancement Project](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps).
